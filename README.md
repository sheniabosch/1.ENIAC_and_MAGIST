#ENIAC and MAGIST
Case Study – Eniac’s Brazil Expansion via Magist (Completed)

Objective: Evaluated Magist as a strategic partner for Eniac’s entry into the Brazilian market using a full snapshot of Magist’s operational database.
Project Goal: Assessed whether Magist supports high-end Apple-compatible tech products and delivers fast, reliable shipping—critical for Eniac’s brand promise—within a 3-year partnership window.
Key Achievements:
Mapped Magist’s database (9 tables: orders, order_items, products, sellers, customers, payments, reviews, geolocation) and built a comprehensive data model.
Analyzed product mix: Only 1.8% of Magist’s catalog is in computers_accessories or electronics—no Apple-compatible accessories found. High-end tech is underrepresented.
Measured delivery performance: Average time from order_purchase to order_delivered_customer = 12.5 days. Only 31% delivered in ≤7 days. Eniac’s current EU average: 3.2 days.
Identified regional bottlenecks: São Paulo & Rio dominate volume, but Northeast Brazil sees 18+ day averages—unacceptable for premium customer experience.
Calculated seller reliability: Top 100 sellers = 68% of volume; review scores ≥4.5, but no tech-specialized sellers in top tier.

Focus: Business-driven data analysis—turning raw SQL into boardroom-ready strategy.
Understood org structure, culture, and expansion pressures
Eniac’s Strategy
Framed Magist partnership in context of Brazil entry goals


Final Recommendation to Leadership:
Do NOT sign the 3-year Magist contract in its current form.
Risk 1: Magist lacks ecosystem for premium Apple accessories—low category share, no specialized sellers.
Risk 2: Delivery speed fails Eniac’s standards—12.5-day average undermines brand trust.
Alternative Path:
Pilot with top 10 tech sellers only (6-month trial)
Negotiate priority shipping SLA (≤5 days in major cities)
Build parallel direct logistics in São Paulo during Year 1
Verdict: Magist = short-term test platform, not long-term partner.
Done with real Magist data—saved Eniac from a brand-damaging leap. Strategy preserved. Expansion on track—just smarter.
Presented to Head of Data & CEO. Decision: Pilot approved, full contract paused.
