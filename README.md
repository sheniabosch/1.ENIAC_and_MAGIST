🇧🇷 ENIAC x MAGIST: Brazil Market Entry Strategy
Data-Driven Expansion Analysis & Risk Assessment
🎯 Project Objective
Evaluated Magist as a potential strategic partner for Eniac’s expansion into the Brazilian market. Using a full snapshot of Magist’s operational database, I assessed whether their infrastructure could uphold Eniac’s brand promise of premium Apple-compatible tech and lightning-fast delivery.

🛠️ Data Architecture & Tech Stack
Database: 9 interconnected tables (Orders, Items, Products, Sellers, Customers, Payments, Reviews, Geolocation).

Tooling: SQL (Data Extraction & Modeling), Business Intelligence (Strategic Analysis).

Focus: Bridging the gap between raw relational data and boardroom-ready strategy.

🔍 Key Insights & Analysis
📦 Product Ecosystem Fit
The Mismatch: Only 1.8% of Magist’s catalog falls under computers_accessories or electronics.

The Apple Gap: Zero specialized Apple-compatible accessories were identified. Magist’s current seller base leans toward general merchandise rather than high-end tech.

🚚 Delivery Performance vs. Brand Standards
The Benchmark: Eniac’s EU average is 3.2 days.

Magist Reality: Average delivery time is 12.5 days.

The Speed Gap: Only 31% of orders reach customers within 7 days.

Regional Bottlenecks: While São Paulo and Rio handle the volume, the Northeast suffers from 18+ day averages—a dealbreaker for premium customer experience.

🤝 Seller Reliability
Concentration: The Top 100 sellers drive 68% of total volume.

Quality: While top-tier sellers maintain high review scores (≥4.5), none are specialized in the premium tech niche Eniac requires.

🚩 Final Recommendation: "Proceed with Caution"
Verdict: Do NOT sign the standard 3-year contract. Magist is currently a short-term test platform, not a long-term strategic partner.

Identified Risks:
Brand Dilution: Lack of a premium tech ecosystem risks positioning Eniac as "just another budget seller."

Logistical Failure: A 12.5-day delivery average undermines Eniac's reputation for speed and reliability.

💡 The "Smarter Expansion" Path:
6-Month Pilot: Limit the launch to the top 10 tech-capable sellers only.

SLA Negotiation: Mandate a priority shipping SLA of ≤5 days in major metropolitan hubs.

Hybrid Logistics: Develop direct logistics in São Paulo during Year 1 to bypass Magist’s regional bottlenecks.

📈 Business Impact
Presented to: Head of Data & CEO.
Outcome: The full 3-year contract was paused. A limited pilot program was approved, saving Eniac from a high-risk, multi-million dollar commitment while keeping the Brazil expansion on track.

"Data didn't just find the problems; it built the bridge to a safer expansion."
